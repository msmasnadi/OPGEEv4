# Contributing to the RMI OPGEEv4 Repository

> [!NOTE]
> This is a WIP and subject to change.

## Branches

### `default`
This exists only to display the updated README notifying users that this is a forked repo and directing them to the original.

### `main`
Primary production branch. Should be stable and will be used as a source for any PRs submitted to the original repo. We'll keep this up to date with the original.

### `dev`
Development/feature source branch. Will be kept up to date with `main`, but all work should start from here.

### `main-rmi`
Production branch for any RMI specific features. Will be kept up to date with `main` but may contain changes we do not want to propagate to OPGEEv4.

### `dev-rmi`
Like `dev` but for RMI specific work.
